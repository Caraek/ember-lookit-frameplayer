exp-lookit-geometry-alternation
==============================================

This frame is deprecated and will not be included in release 2.x.
Please see `the old docs <https://lookit.github.io/lookit-frameplayer-docs/classes/Exp-lookit-geometry-alternation.html>`__.

Consider instead
------------------

The more general-purpose :ref:`exp-lookit-change-detection` frame which shows streams of images on each side, or
:ref:`exp-lookit-video` if you'd rather provide premade videos.
