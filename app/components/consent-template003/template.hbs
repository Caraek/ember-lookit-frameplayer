  <p> A research team led by Pawan Sinha, PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
    {{PIName}} at {{institution}} are running this study, "{{experiment.name}}," Prediction and
    Interception Research Study (PAIRS) on Lookit a web-based research study platform. </p>

  <p> {{procedures}} </p>

  <p class="exp-text-medium"> Participation </p>
  <p> You and your child are free to choose whether to be in this study. If you and your child choose to participate, it's okay to stop at any point during the session. Please pause or stop the session if your child becomes very fussy or does not want to participate! If this is a study with multiple sessions, it's okay not to complete all the sessions.</p>

  <p class="exp-text-medium"> Will there be any risk or discomfort to me? </p>
  <p>There is no risk involved in this study. Your child will perform non-strenuous movements with their hands to press keys or to control a computer mouse or touchpad. Your child can take breaks between games whenever he/she may feel tired. If you notice any discomfort in your child during the study, you can stop the activity at any time.</p>

  <p class="exp-text-medium"> Will I benefit by being in this research? </p>
  <p>This studyâ€™s goal is to learn about the abilities of children with and without autism spectrum disorder to interact with moving objects. If we are successful, then the results could inform future studies of autism, improve diagnosis, and may even potentially deliver therapeutic interventions that may help children improve their motor skills and other abilities.
    You and your child will not benefit directly from this research; however, we hope that the results will ultimately benefit children by improving scientific understanding of autism.

  <p class="exp-text-medium"> Data collection and webcam recording </p>
  <p> During the session, you and your child will be recorded via your computer's webcam and microphone. Video recordings and other data you enter are sent securely to the Lookit platform and stored indefinitely. At the end of the session, you will be prompted to choose a privacy level for your webcam recordings. You will have the option to withdraw your video data at this point. You can view your past recordings on Lookit under "Studies" -> "Your past studies" at any time.</p>
  <p>Data is stored securely on Lookit servers and by researchers. However, there is always a small risk that data transmitted over the internet may be intercepted or that the security of stored data may be compromised.</p>
  <p>No video clips will be published or shared unless you allow this when selecting a privacy level. If we do not receive a consent recording (the video you'll make to the right) for this session and cannot verify that you agreed to participate, no other video from your session will be viewed.</p>

  <p class="exp-text-medium"> Use of data</p>
  <p>The research group led by Pawan Sinha, PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and  {{PIName}} at {{institution}} will have access to video and other
    data collected during this session. We will also have access to your account profile, demographic survey, and the child profile for the child who is participating, including changes you make in the future to any of this information. We may study your child's responses in connection with his or her previous responses to this or other studies run by our group, siblings' responses to this or other studies run by our group, or demographic survey responses.</p>
  <p>

    For those individuals who participated in the SPARK part of this study, we are asking your consent for the SPARK study, hosted by the Simons Foundation, to share with Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Northeastern University researchers the clinical, demographic and genetic data collected during your participation in SPARK. This information will be shared using your linked research ID number and using a secure transfer system. We are also asking for your consent to share the data we collect during the web-based study at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Northeastern University with SPARK, in order to add to the information that was collected during your participation in SPARK. Please note that because you are a participant in both studies, SPARK and this study will be able to share and link your identifying information as well as any future data you may contribute to either project.

  </p>
  <p>
    The Simons Foundation funds innovative research and provides coded data access (data with your identifying information removed) to qualified researchers. Researchers can file an application with the Simons Foundation to obtain access to your study data for research purposes. Experts at the Simons Foundation who protect health and science information will look at every request carefully to minimize risks to your privacy.

  <p class="exp-text-medium"> Use of data by Lookit </p>
  <p> Because this study is being run on the Lookit platform, researchers working on the Lookit project at MIT will also have access to the data collected during this session, in addition to your account data, child profiles, and demographic survey responses. This data may be used by Lookit to detect and fix technical problems or identify new features that would be helpful; provide support to study researchers; assess data quality (for instance, how well an observer can tell which direction children are looking); evaluate the site's success in reaching a diverse population; and characterize family engagement (for instance, looking at what aspects of a study make parents more interested in coming back later). </p>

  <p class="exp-text-medium"> Publication of results </p>
  <p> The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Raw data (for instance, looking times to the left and right of the screen) may be published when it cannot identify children. We never publish children's birthdates or names, and we never publish your demographic data in conjunction with your child's video. </p>

    <p> As part of your participation, we will collect certain personal information about you, including: {{gdpr_personal_data}}. In addition, we will collect special category data, your personal information that is especially sensitive: {{gdpr_sensitive_data}}</p>

    <p>Your personal information will be transferred to the United States. You understand that the data protection and privacy laws of the United States may not offer you the same level of protection as those in your country of origin.</p>
