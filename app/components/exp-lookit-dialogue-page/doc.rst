exp-lookit-dialogue-page
==============================================

This frame is deprecated and will not be included in release 2.x.
Please see `the old docs <https://lookit.github.io/lookit-frameplayer-docs/releases/v1.3.1/classes/Exp-lookit-dialogue-page.html>`__.

Consider instead
------------------

- :ref:`exp-lookit-images-audio`, which should be able to do everything this frame can, but more reliably and with more options! (:ref:`Update guide <update_dialogue_to_images>`)
