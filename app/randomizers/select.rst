.. _select:

select
==============================================

Overview
------------------

Randomizer to allow selection of one (or arbitrary sequence) of defined frames.

This is unlikely to be useful on its own! It is intended to be used either:

- within a :ref:`random-parameter-set` randomizer, with different ``parameterSets`` picking out
  different values for ``whichFrames``)
- via the :ref:`exp-frame-select` frame, which allows you to set `whichFrames` using a custom
  ``generateProperties`` function. (Note that you can't add a ``generateProperties`` function
  directly to a randomizer - that's why you'd use the regular frame instead.)

To use, define a frame with ``"kind": "choice"`` and ``"sampler": "select"``,
as shown below, in addition to the parameters described under 'properties'.

Example
----------------

This will always show "Let's think about hippos!" because it picks out the first frame (``"whichFrames": 0``):

                    }
                ]

                    {
                        "emph": false,
                        "text": "Let's think about dolphins!",
                        "title": "FRAME 2"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }


Parameters
----------------

.. glossary::

    frameOptions [Array]
        List of frames that can be created by this randomizer. Each frame is an
        object with any necessary frame-specific properties specified. The
        'kind' of frame can be specified either here (per frame) or in
        commonFrameProperties. If a property is defined for a given frame both
        in this frame list and in commonFrameProperties, the value in the frame
        list will take precedence.

        (E.g., you could include 'kind': 'normal-frame' in
        commmonFrameProperties, but for a single frame in frameOptions, include
        'kind': 'special-frame'.)


    commonFrameProperties [Object]
        Object describing common parameters to use in EVERY frame created
        by this randomizer. Parameter names and values are as described in
        the documentation for the frameType used.

    whichFrames [Number or Array]
        Index or indices (0-indexed) within ``frameOptions`` to actually use. This can be either a number
        (e.g., 0 to use the first option or 1 to use the second option) or an array providing
        an ordered list of indices to use (e.g., [1, 0] to use the second then first options).
        All indices must be integers in [0, frameOptions.length).

        If not provided or -1, the entire ``frameOptions`` list is used in order. (If an empty
        list is provided, however, that is respected and no frames are inserted by this
        randomizer.)


Data collected
----------------

The information returned by this randomizer will be available in ``expData["conditions"]["THIS-RANDOMIZER-ID"]``. The
randomizer ID will depend on its order in the study - for instance, ``6-test-trials``.

    whichFrames [Array]
        the index/indices of the frame(s) used, as provided to this frame
